	<p>Copyright 2016 The Mulish Project Authors (<a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/mulish">https://github.com/googlefonts/mulish</a>)<br /><br />This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.<br />This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:<br /><a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL">http://scripts.sil.org/OFL</a><br /><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br />SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007<br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />PREAMBLE<br />The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br />development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br />efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br />open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br />with others.<br /><br />The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br />redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br />fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, <br />redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br />names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br />however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br />requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br />to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<br /><br />DEFINITIONS<br />"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright<br />Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may<br />include source files, build scripts and documentation.<br /><br />"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the<br />copyright statement(s).<br /><br />"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as<br />distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).<br /><br />"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,<br />or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the<br />Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a<br />new environment.<br /><br />"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical<br />writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.<br /><br />PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS<br />Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br />a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,<br />redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font<br />Software, subject to the following conditions:<br /><br />1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,<br />in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.<br /><br />2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,<br />redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy<br />contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be<br />included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or<br />in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or<br />binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.<br /><br />3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font<br />Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding<br />Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as<br />presented to the users.<br /><br />4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font<br />Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br />Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the<br />Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written<br />permission.<br /><br />5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,<br />must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be<br />distributed under any other license.
