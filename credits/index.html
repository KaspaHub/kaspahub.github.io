The<br />fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, <br />redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br />names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br />however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br />requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br />to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<br /><br />DEFINITIONS<br />"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright<br />Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such.

This restriction only applies to the primary font name as<br />presented to the users.<br /><br />4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font<br />Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br />Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the<br />Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written<br />permission.<br /><br />5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,<br />must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be<br />distributed under any other license.
