# License & Usage

Kaspa Hub is freely available for anyone to use, copy, and create localized versions. You are encouraged to adapt and translate the platform to serve your community better.

However, there is one requirement:
All pages must include the original &lt;footer&gt; element unchanged, except for the home page where it can be omitted or customized.

This ensures consistent attribution and community connection across all versions of Kaspa Hub.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or want to share your localized version!
